# Look At This

### About

Look At This is a website designed for location sharing between its users. While not logged in you can browse through shared locations, but you need to log in to share a location, and, if you've already shared a location, to edit or delete it. If you did not share a location, you cannot edit or delete it. Any user can comment on any location.

Locations are displayed with an image of the location, its description and its location on the map. The name of the user that posted the location is also displayed under the location.
