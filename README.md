### About

Look At This is a website designed for sharing locations of interest between its users. Locations on the website are displayed with a picture, title, description and an embedded map to show where it is on the map. Users can optionally add tags as well to further categorize the location.

People can see shared locations without an account.
But logging in lets you:
- add a location
- edit/delete one of the locations you added
- add comments to any location
